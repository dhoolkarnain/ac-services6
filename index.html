        What is an air conditioner?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          An air conditioner is a unit or a machine, which works on closed
          premises. It basically treats the air inside the room with the
          refrigeration cycle. It removes the hot air present in the room and
          replaces it with cold air that results in the decreased temperature
          of your room, home, office or workstation. It comes in multiple
          variants such as window, split, tower and centralizes. People have
          an option to purchase the air conditioner according to their
          requirements. The air conditioners are available in different
          capacities like 1 ton, 1.5 ton, 2 ton and many more according to the
          residential and commercial needs.

        Which AC service is good, normal wet or Jet Pump service?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          There are two kinds of AC service, normal wet service and Jet Pump
          service. Both have their own speciality. Let’s see a glimpse of both
          the AC services: Normal wet service: It involves cleaning of
          internal parts of AC’s internal parts like cleaning of filters and
          coils with the water pressure. If the AC unit is window based then
          we will clean it near the water body to achieve the best results.
          Jet Pump Service: This AC service is based upon high air pressure up
          to 40Bar. In this service, we used to flush washing and cleaning AC
          coils. The tools in this type of service are compact, lightweight
          and provide unbeatable flushing performance. It is also known as Jet
          AC coil cleaning machine
        </p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        Why in every summer season, AC service essential?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Your AC unit whether it is widow, split, or tower required servicing
          every season before use. An air conditioner needs yearly basis
          servicing like your car for efficient performance. You should do
          this in the spring season before starting its use in the hottest
          summer, which increases its life and helps it for the best cooling
          in less power consumption. AC units contain filters, coils, fins and
          other electrical and mechanical accessories which require regular
          yearly basis maintenance. If you ignore this Maintenance, you will
          see a decline in its performance and increased power consumption
          that will reflect in your electricity bill.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        How AC service creates a positive impact on your AC life?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Servicing your air conditioner is like you are greasing and taking
          care of its internal parts. Like a human body needs a regular health
          check-up to keep a body fit and fine. In the same way, an air
          conditioner unit requires regular maintenance. An air conditioner’s
          filters, coils, fins work continuously in the summer season and stay
          non-functional in the other seasons. Sometimes they get jammed and
          get affected by dust particles which require to be cleaned before
          using it again. If you regularly maintain the inner parts of your
          air conditioner unit it automatically increases its performance and
          efficiency. Regular servicing and maintenance also increase the life
          cycle of your air conditioner unit.

        Why does Gas from your AC leaks?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          There is a various reason for gas leakage from your AC like vibration, which tends the refrigerant line
          together. When the evaporating oil or condensing coin corrodes by reacting with the atmosphere, it may also
          lead to leaking the gas.

        Which AC should I purchase, window or split AC?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          A single AC is ideal for a room up to 200 sq feet. If your room has space but you are constrained on a budget
          then you should opt for window AC. Its installation is quite simple and does not require any renovation in a
          room. While on the other hand, split AC offers you quieter operations but it is costlier and requires
          additional cost for installation. This is the basic difference. You can check your room requirements and buy a
          perfect AC for your home.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        What are the advantages of window AC?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          If we talk about window AC, it has its own advantages when compared to a split AC. First of all, it requires
          less space and can be fixed in any window with the support of the wall. You don’t have to change or do any
          structural changes in your room. It is comparatively less expensive and energy-efficient as compared to the
          Split AC.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        Where should I install a window AC??
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Window AC should be installed a minimum of 5 feet high from the floor. There should be enough distance between
          the AC and its users because the air draft from the unit does not hit directly to the users.
